 
Mapping to ecoinvent database:

- "demo_eidb": to mapping ecoinvent database, either using "reference product name", or "activity name", it's possible to try first model search within ISIC product category, second model use screened EIDB based on the selected ISIC category, save a lot time, but not accurate for some product

- "demo_eidb_comb_RP_Act_Geo": mapping with combined [reference product name / activity name / and Geography] (more accurate, more time to run)
