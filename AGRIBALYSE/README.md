AGRIBALYSE® data is freely available: https://doc.agribalyse.fr/documentation-en/agribalyse-data/data-access

we use 'simplified version, accessible to everyone : '
- two spreadsheets for raw conventional agricultural products and organic products (at the farm gate)
- a spreadsheet for feed (available soon),
- a spreadsheet for ready-to-eat food products

In the notebook, we extract mapping for above listed LCI, with each product's LCIA scores (user-selected, e.g., Climate change) plotted:
- demo_AGRIBALYSE_farm-gate_whLCIA: "raw conventional agricultural products and organic products (at the farm gate)", with a final single LCIA showed
- demo_AGRIBALYSE_ready-to-eat_product_whLCIA: "ready-to-eat food products", each product with following different life cycle (LC) stage and LCIA score plotted: 
  - "agriculture" -> Agriculture
  - "transformation" ->  Transformation
  - "pack" -> Emballage
  - "trnspt" ->  Transport
  - "shop" -> Supermarché et distribution
  - "consume"->  Consommation
  - "total" ->  Total
